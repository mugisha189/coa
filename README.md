## Introduction

This repository contains a simple image gallery and some JavaScript challenges. The image gallery can be viewed by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser, and the challenges can be run using Node.js.

## Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command:
```
  git clone https://github.com/mugisha189/coa.git
```
4. Navigate into the cloned repository:

## Gallery

The gallery can be viewed by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser. Make sure the following files and directories are correctly placed:

- `index.html` in the root directory.
- `styles.css` in the root directory.
- Images in the `images` directory must also be in the root directory.

### Running the Gallery

To view the gallery, open the `index.html` file in any web browser. Ensure the `styles.css` file is in the same directory as `index.html` and the images are in the `images` folder.

## Challenges

This section contains JavaScript challenges that can be run using Node.js.

### Running the Challenges

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check if Node.js is installed by running:

```sh
node -v
```

If Node.js is installed, you will see the version number. If not, you will need to install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Once Node.js is installed, you can run the challenges by navigating to the `challenges` directory and running the following commands:

#### Array Map Challenge

```sh
node challenges/arrayMap.js
```

#### String Transform Challenge

```sh
node challenges/stringTransform.js
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have Node.js installed to run the challenges.
- The gallery can be viewed by simply opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.
- Make sure all files are in their correct locations for everything to work properly.
